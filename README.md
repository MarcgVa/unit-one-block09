# unit-one-block09
This is an attempt to build a personal website about me and my projects.

The project is a two part project.

#Part 1a:
During this project we were instructed to build a 3 page website about ourselves.

Pages:
  - Home
  - Portfolio
  - About

Home - Discusses my interests and has my favorite quote.
Portfolio - Contains a few of my favorite projects
About - Is a deeper dive into me and my likes.


#Part 1b:
In addition to the webpages we had to create a new GitHub Kanban Project and enter the cards required to complete the project.
